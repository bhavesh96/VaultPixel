# VaultPixel

**VaultPixel** is a simple game discovery web app I built to explore how real-world projects connect with external APIs.  
It lets you search, filter, and browse video games using data from the free [RAWG.io](https://rawg.io/apidocs) API.

I wanted to work on something different from the usual ‚Äúmovie app‚Äù tutorials ‚Äî something visual, data-rich, and a bit more fun.  
VaultPixel came out of that idea.

## What I Learned

While building VaultPixel, I practiced:
- Working with an external REST API (handling queries, filters, and pagination)
- Managing app state with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Creating reusable components (search bar, game cards, filters)
- Handling responsive design with Tailwind utilities
- Cleaning up API calls and optimizing for user experience

It started as a small weekend project, but I ended up polishing it much more than I expected.

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## About

I built VaultPixel to strengthen my understanding of React, REST APIs, and modern front-end development practices.
It‚Äôs not a huge project, but it reflects how I like to learn ‚Äî by building things that look real and work smoothly.
